Subsequent payment occurs in installments (25%) after each stage of completed work. ▪️ Prepayment - as a rule, goes towards the purchase of draft materials. ▪️ After completion of the 1st stage (plumbing and electrical work, installation, dismantling of walls). ▪️ After completion of the 2nd stage (after rough finishing work and preparation of walls and ceilings for final finishing). ▪️ After completion of the 3rd stage (finishing and complete completion of all work). After each stage, a certificate of completion of work is signed."

As a result, the design project meets your expectations as much as possible."
